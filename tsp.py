#  Now we have to solve the TSP, so we first have to define the distance between every pixel.
#  In this case, weâ€™re going to define distance between two pixels as the Euclidean distance between their x,y coordinates in the image.
#  With that definition in mind, we can calculate the distances between all size(8000) pixels:
#  The result is a giant 8,000 x 8,000 matrix with the Euclidean distances between every pixel.

# Now we provide the Matrix to a TSP sover package which returns the optimized path matrix.
# The library implements a simple "greedy" algorithm:
# Initially, each vertex belongs to its own path fragment. Each path fragment has length 1.
# Find 2 nearest disconnected path fragments and connect them.
# Repeat, until there are at least 2 path fragments.
# This algorightm has polynomial complexity.
